This repository contains the files to recreate the graphs. 

I used the "iso1_onp_a2_1kb_30x_LD0_K25_KCOV2_ADAPT0.01_MINOVL35_RMCHIM1_asm_new_np_pilon_pilon.fasta" as the experimental data. 
The reference genome of D. melanogaster is from flybase. The version of the reference genome is r6.24. 

There are also 2 screenshots of the graphs that the program created.
